# sequencer
A grid-item activation-sequence designer app made with React and Grommet

## What

Imagine the following layout, where `X` means activated, and `0` means idle:

```
+---------+----------+----------+
|         |          |          |
|         |          |          |
|    X    |    0     |    0     |
|         |          |          |
|         |          |          |
+-------------------------------+
|         |          |          |
|         |          |          |
|    0    |    0     |    0     |
|         |          |          |
|         |          |          |
+---------+----------+----------+
```

This tool is designed to define the activation sequence in a given timeline.

## Why

1. So I can train my React-fu.
2. Because I will use this as the base of a greater private project.
3. Why not?
